	<!-- NOTES -->
	<!-- raise "fitness gain per tile to player flee" to make them like to flee when hurt -->
	<!-- if "fitness gain per tile to player" is less than (fitness gain for not having to move) / (move points), the AI just... won't move -->
	<!-- if random fitness is very high, they might not actually want to approach you much -->
	
	<!-- AI ideas -->
	<!-- drunkard: high random, ignores traps, barely attracted to player -->
	<!-- thief: medium random, strongly avoids traps, very high flee -->
	<!-- berserker: low random, ignores traps, high approach priority, no flee -->
	<!-- big guy: low random, likes to stand in place, low flee, low approach -->
	<!-- minsweeper: enemy who purposefully tries to step on traps (for an enemy with high trap resistance obviously) -->
